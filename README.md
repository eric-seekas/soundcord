##How to contribute
Please ensure that you provide appropriate test coverage and ensure the documentation is up-to-date. It's encouraged that you perform your changes in a clean topic branch rather than master, and create a pull request for your changes to be discussed and reviewed.

Please also keep your commits atomic so that they are more likely to apply cleanly. That means that each commit should contain the smallest possible logical change.
