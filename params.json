There is no such person!\r\n\r\nIn this case, the use of SoundCord (especially in combination with fuzzy matching algorithms) can significantly simplify the problem.\r\n\r\n##Installation\r\nInstall it through terminal:\r\n\r\n`gem install soundcord`\r\n\r\nOr, if you want to get the latest, you can get master from the main SoundCord repository:\r\n\r\n`gem \"soundcord\", :git => \"git@github.com:lukasalexandre/soundcord.git\"`\r\n\r\nIf you`are trying to use features that don't seem to be in the latest released gem, but are mentioned in the README, then you probably need to specify the master branch if you want to use them. This README is probably ahead of the latest released version, if you're reading it on GitHub.\r\n\r\n###Rails integration\r\nTo easily integrate SoundCord with rails, please visit: http://lukasalexandre.github.com/soundcord_rails\r\n\r\n##Usage\r\nWords can be phonetically transformed:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n\"João\".phonetize # \"J\"\r\n\"Maria\".phonetize # \"MR\"\r\n\"Helena\".phonetize # \"LM\"\r\n\"Walmir\".phonetize # \"VLM\"\r\n\r\n\"gnome\".phonetize # \"NM\"\r\n\"pneumonic\".phonetize # \"NMNK\"\r\n\"theater\".phonetize # \"0TR\"\r\n\"crutch\".phonetize # \"KRX\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd also, compared:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n\"Walmir\".homophone? \"Valmir\" # true\r\n\"Courtiney\".homophone? \"kourtiney\" # true\r\n```\r\n\r\nArray's can be searched for homonyms:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ncollection = [\"leonardo\", \"lucene\", \"rodrigo\", \"luciana\", \"lussene\"]\r\ncollection.homophones \"lucene\" # [\"lucene\", \"luciana\", \"lussene\"]\r\n\r\ncollection = [\"mail\", \"male\", \"main\", \"Maine\", \"mane\"]\r\ncollection.homophones \"main\" # [\"main\", \"Maine\", \"mane\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\n##Setting language\r\nThe language, to be used in comparisons, can be defined through the following lines:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nSoundCord.load_language \"pt-BR\"\r\nSoundCord.load_language \"en\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf no language is defined SoundCord will fallback to its default, pt-BR.\r\n\r\n##Information\r\n\r\n###Language support\r\nSoundCord was idealized to support a wide range of languages. Currently, we are supporting these:\r\n\r\n* Brazilian Portuguese;\r\n* English.\r\n\r\nWe are already working on supporting these:\r\n\r\n* Spanish.\r\n\r\n###To do\r\n* Support for collection;\r\n* Support for phrases;\r\n\r\n##How to contribute\r\nPlease ensure that you provide appropriate test coverage and ensure the documentation is up-to-date. It is encouraged that you perform changes in a clean topic branch rather than a master and that you create a pull request for them. This will facilitate discussion and revision.\r\n\r\nPlease be clean, keep your commits atomic and with the smallest possible logical change. This will increase the likelihood of your submission to be used.\r\n\r\n###Bug reports\r\nIf you discover any bugs, feel free to create an issue on GitHub. Please add as much information as possible to help us fixing the possible bug.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/lukasalexandre/soundcord/issues\r\n\r\n##License\r\nCopyright (c) 2012 Lukas Alexandre. http://www.devinscene.com.br/\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\r\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\r\n\"Software\"), to use, copy and modify copies of the Software, subject\r\nto the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\r\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\r\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\r\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\r\nNONINFRINGEMENT.
